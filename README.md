# World_Weather_Analysis
Using APIs to Visualize Weather Data

## Overview
Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide. Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. Use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
#### Update
Add the weather description to the weather data popup. From the list of potential travel destinations, choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
